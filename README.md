There are no advertisements, no premium features, no subscriptions, and no hidden fees within the app. This project has absolutely no commercial value or financial intent.

### 2. A Custom Browser with Content Filtering

Echo Music acts strictly as a specialized, third-party web browser and client. It simply parses the publicly available website content and APIs of YouTube and YouTube Music, rendering them in a custom user interface. The ad-free experience it provides is fundamentally no different from using a standard web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Brave) equipped with a common ad-blocking extension (such as uBlock Origin).

### 3. Support Content Creators

We deeply respect the hard work of artists, musicians, and content creators. We strongly encourage all users to subscribe to [YouTube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium). Purchasing a Premium subscription is the best way to financially support the creators you listen to and ensure the continued growth of the platform. Echo Music is built as a proof-of-concept for developers and enthusiasts, not to harm creators' revenues.

### 4. No Hosting of Copyrighted Material

We do not host, upload, distribute, or store any audio, video, or copyrighted media files on our own servers. All content accessed through this application is stored entirely on Google's/YouTube's servers and remains the property of their respective copyright owners. The app merely acts as a conduit to stream publicly accessible links.

### 5. User Responsibility & Legal Contact

The software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. The developers of Echo Music do not encourage or condone piracy. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their usage of this app complies with their local copyright laws and the Terms of Service of the platforms they access.

Because we do not host any media files, we cannot process DMCA takedown requests for audio or video content. However, if you represent a copyright holder or have legal concerns regarding the open-source code itself, please contact us via email at: [hello@echomusic.fun](mailto:hello@echomusic.fun)
